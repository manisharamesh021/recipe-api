- View all recipes
- Get total record count
- Filter recipes by query parameters
- Access recipe data via HTTP endpoints

It is designed as a beginner-friendly backend project using Flask and SQL.

- Ensure the route is defined in `app.py`
- Restart the Flask server after making changes
- Check the URL spelling
